# Hi — I’m Zoromenta 👋

Full‑stack engineer • product‑minded maker • storyteller  
Pronouns: they/them • Based in: [City, Country] • Open to remote & freelance

## 🎯 Tagline
Building fast, accessible web experiences with React, Node, and TypeScript — with a dash of personality.

---

## 🧭 Life & background
I grew up taking things apart to see how they worked — radios, old PCs, and later my first Arduino. That curiosity turned into a love for building tools people actually use.

I’m mostly self‑taught and learned by shipping small projects for my local community. Since then I’ve worked across product teams, focusing on performance, UX, and developer experience. When I’m not coding, I make pixel art, compose synthwave loops, and run volunteer workshops teaching teens how to build simple web apps.
